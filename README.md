# Metric Learning on Saycam Dataset

The project focuses on making a neural network learn from the same visuals that a human child comes across during its cognitive development. To achieve this, we use video data collected over a period of 2 years from cameras mounted on various human subjects (6-32 mo). Our approach is based on Self Supervised Metric Learning with N-Pair Multi-class Ranking Loss.
